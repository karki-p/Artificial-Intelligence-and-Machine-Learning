# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning
Classification and Regression Tasks in AI and ML. Open source datasets which are obtained from Kaggle are used to train models in following tasks. 
The files are rendered ipynb file. 
**Various machine learining algorithms are demonstrated using datasets for training model and predict the accuracy. Data visualization, data cleaning,
  data analysis, building models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and image classification with deep learning are performed.**
  
**Coursework-1**
- Entropy and Information gain.ipynb
- Hyperparameter tuning

**Portfolio-1**
- Random Forest Classifier, KNN, and Logistic Regression models for classifying and and cross-validation and hyper-parameters tuning for better accuracy. 

**Portfolio-2**
- Image classification using Deep Learning model using features from tensorflow library.
